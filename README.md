## _About_ 🔴

CalistheniX is a WebApp that allows you to plan your workouts, learn new exercises, have constant access to information such as nutrition guides, trick drills and many more!

The most important feature of CalistheniX is that it allows you to keep track of your workouts, so you can have a detailed representation of your progression through Graphs from your personal dashboard.

But wait.. There's more!

Tracking your progression is not the only history this app may keep for you. You can also keep track of body metrics such as weight, waist measurement, bicep measurement and more as well as nutrition related metrics like how many calories you ate per day, fats, carbs and proteins.
